# Basic Ray Tracer
This is a basic ray tracer written in C++. I wrote it when I started my Computer Graphics study and to understand how the holy grail of CG actually works.

There is a small software(OpenSeeIt) provided in my repository which will help you open and look to the generated ppm image of the ray tracer.
